# Tasks

- [x] Break `query-relationships` into two different queries: `query-dependencies` and `query-dependents`. Restructure the `GenerateRelationships` method to build out `Dependencies` and `Dependents` sub-sections in the `Relationships` section.
- [ ] Break `query-map` into two different queries: `map-dependencies` and `map-dependents`. Restructure the `GenerateMap` method to build out `Dependencies` and `Dependents` sub-sections in the `Dependency Map` section. `Dependency Map` should be simplified to just `Map`.
